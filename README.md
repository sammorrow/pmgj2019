# PMGJ Project - Totally Not Street Fighter!

## Overview

Simple tug-of-war game, built with Phaser.

## Setup

### 1. Clone this repo

In your terminal, navigate into your workspace directory and run:

```git clone https://github.com/sammorrow/pmgj2019.git```

### 2. Install node.js and npm:

https://nodejs.org/en/

### 3. Install dependencies:

Navigate to the cloned repo's directory and run:

```npm install```

### 4. Run the development server:

In the same directory, run:

```npm run dev```

This will run a server so you can run the game in a browser. It will also start a watch process, so you can change the source and the process will recompile and refresh the browser automatically.

To run the game, open your browser and enter http://localhost:3000 into the address bar.

## Build for deployment:

In the appropriate directory, run:

```npm run deploy```

This will optimize and minimize the compiled bundle.

## Deploy for cordova:

Make sure to uncomment the cordova.js file in the src/index.html and to update config.xml with your informations. (name/description...)

More informations about the cordova configuration:
https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/config_ref/

There is 3 platforms actually tested and supported : 
- browser

- android

First run (ios example):

```
npm run cordova
cordova platform add ios
cordova run ios
```

Update (ios example):

```
npm run cordova
cordova platform update ios
cordova run ios
```

This will optimize and minimize the compiled bundle.
